    <!-- Questions and Answers -->
    <h2>What is the difference between &lt;b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;?</h2>
    <p>
        The &lt;b&gt; tag is used only to make text bold visually, while the &lt;strong&gt; tag
        is used to give importance to the text and also makes it bold.

    <h3>What is Structural Markup?</h3>
    <p>
        Structural markup is used to structure content on a webpage. It defines headings,
        paragraphs, lists, and layout of the content.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Semantic Markup?</h3>
    <p>
        Semantic markup uses tags that clearly describe the meaning of the content, such as
        &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;.
    </p>

    <h3>Two Examples of Structural Tags</h3>
    <p>
        Examples of structural tags are &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt;.

        <li>&lt;section&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;header&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;footer&gt;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why should semantic tags be preferred over only visual tags?</h3>
    <p>
        Semantic tags should be preferred because they clearly explain the meaning of the content.
        They improve accessibility, help search engines understand the page better, and make the
        code more organized and professional.
