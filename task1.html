    <h1> THE CORRECT FILE NAME FOR AN HTML FILE</h1>
    <p>The correct file name for an HTML file should end with .html.This extension tells the browser that the file contains HTML code.</p>
    <h1>PORPOSE OF DOCTYPE HTML</h1>
    <P>The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5.It helps the browser display the page correctly.</P>
    <h1> Differences between &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt</h1>
    <p>1. The &lt;head&gt; tag contains information about the page, while the &lt;body&gt; tag contains visible content.<br>
        2. The &lt;head&gt; is not shown on the browser, but the &lt;body&gt; is shown.<br>
        3. The &lt;head&gt; includes title and meta tags, while the &lt;body&gt; includes text, images, and links.</p>
    <h2>What happens if the &lt;head&gt; tag is removed?</h2>
    <p>If the &lt;head&gt; tag is removed, the browser may still show the page,
        but important information like title and metadata will not work properly.
    </p>
    <h2>Which part of the HTML document is visible on the browser screen, and why?</h2>
    <p>
        The &lt;body&gt; part is visible on the browser because it contains all the content
        such as text, images, headings, and links that users see.
    </p>

    <h2>Where is the &lt;title&gt; tag written, and what is its purpose?</h2>
    <p>
        The &lt;title&gt; tag is written inside the &lt;head&gt; tag.
        Its purpose is to show the page title on the browser tab.
