    <h1>Using the IMG Tag</h1>

    <!-- Image with src, alt, and width -->
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/36/fc/26/36fc2635dbb77d55f5170ddb889a3c18.jpg" alt="Profile picture of a user" width="1500" height="1000">

    <p>
        The alt attribute is important because it provides text information about the image.
        It helps users who cannot see images, such as screen reader users, and also displays
        useful text if the image does not load.

    <h2>Correct Code for Given Folder Structure</h2>

    <p>
        Folder structure: Project → index.html → images → profile.jpg
    </p>

    <p>Correct HTML code:</p>

    <p>
        &lt;img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile picture" width="200"&gt;
    </p>

    <p>
        This path works because the image file is inside the "images" folder, which is located
        in the same directory as index.html. The browser follows the folder path to find and
        display the image correctly.
    </p>

    <h2>What happens if an image file is missing or the path is wrong?</h2>
    <p>
        If an image file is missing or the path is incorrect, the browser does not display the image.
        Instead, it shows a broken image icon. The alt text helps users by showing descriptive text
        so they can understand what the image was supposed to represent.
    </p>

    <h2>Why should images be used carefully on websites?</h2>
    <p>
        Images should be used carefully because large images can slow down page loading.
        Too many images can also affect user experience by making a page cluttered.
        Proper use of images and alt text is important for accessibility, especially for users
        who rely on screen readers.

    <h2>Images in Real Websites</h2>

    <h3>Where are images used?</h3>
    <p>
        Images are commonly used in profile pictures, product photos, blog posts, banners,
        advertisements, and social media posts.
    </p>

    <h3>Why are images important for communication, not just design?</h3>
    <p>
        Images help explain ideas quickly, show emotions, and make information easier to understand.
        For example, charts, diagrams, and photos often communicate better than long blocks of text.
    </p>

    <h3>When should an image be used instead of text, and when should text be preferred?</h3>
    <p>
        Images should be used when visual explanation is necessary, such as showing a product,
        a diagram, or a real-life example. Text should be preferred when explaining detailed
        information, instructions, or content that needs to be searchable and accessible.
