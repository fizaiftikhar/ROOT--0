    <h1>Basic Table</h1>

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Class</th>
            <th>Marks</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>fiza iftikhar</td>
            <td>10th</td>
            <td>82</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>minahil zahid</td>
            <td>10th</td>
            <td>90</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>saba zubair</td>
            <td>10th</td>
            <td>85</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        The &lt;table&gt; tag creates the table. The &lt;tr&gt; tag is used for each table row.
        The &lt;th&gt; tag is used for table headings, and the &lt;td&gt; tag is used for table data cells.
    </p>

    <h2>Question about incorrect use of &lt;th&gt;</h2>
    <p>
        Why is it wrong to use the &lt;th&gt; tag for all rows just because it looks bold, and when should
        the &lt;th&gt; tag actually be used?
    </p>
    <p>
        This thinking is wrong because the &lt;th&gt; tag is not for styling but for meaning. It should only
        be used for headings of rows or columns, not for normal data. Using it incorrectly can confuse
        screen readers and reduce accessibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Table with Caption and Column Headings</h2>

    <table border="1">
        <caption>Student Marks Table</caption>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Subject</th>
            <th>Marks</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Aqsa Majid</td>
            <td>Math</td>
            <td>70</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Nimra naseer</td>
            <td>Computer Science</td>
            <td>92</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Captions are important because they describe what the table is about. By default, the caption
        appears at the top of the table.
    </p>

    <h2>What is the difference between a table row and a table column?</h2>
    <p>
        A table row is created using the &lt;tr&gt; tag and runs horizontally across the table.
        Columns are created using &lt;td&gt; and &lt;th&gt; tags inside each row and run vertically
        through the table.
    </p>

    <h2>Student Records Table</h2>

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Class</th>
            <th>Subject</th>
            <th>Marks</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Aleezay shahbaz</td>
            <td>10th</td>
            <td>English</td>
            <td>82</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Mariyam usman</td>
            <td>10th</td>
            <td>Biology</td>
            <td>89</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Why are tables suitable for this data and why should they not be used for layout?</h2>
    <p>
        Tables are suitable for this data because student records are structured and organized into
        rows and columns. This makes the data easy to read and understand. However, tables should not
        be used for page layout because they make the code messy, reduce accessibility, and make
        websites harder to maintain compared to modern layout methods like CSS.
    </p>

    <h2>How do table headings help screen readers and accessibility tools?</h2>
    <p>
        The &lt;th&gt; tag provides semantic meaning by identifying headings in the table. Screen readers
        use this structure to understand relationships between data cells. This helps users with visual
        impairments navigate and understand the table more easily.
